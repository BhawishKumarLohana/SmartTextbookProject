SDG 01: **NO POVERTY** End poverty in all its forms everywhere.

HKBU's contributions to the SDGs have been mapped through a diverse range of methodologies. This approach ensures a comprehensive mapping of our efforts, allowing us to effectively measure and evaluate our progress in achieving the SDGs. This report covers the period from 2023 to 2024. **REPORT**

#### Course mapping

HKBU has implemented a comprehensive mapping exercise to evaluate the integration of the SDGs within in our curriculum. Through a systematic review of our courses, this mapping exercise showcases our commitment to equipping students with the necessary skills and knowledge to address global challenges and complex societal issues both now and in the future.

To conduct this mapping exercise, HKBU has adopted an SDG keyword mapping approach. Leveraging text-mining techniques and methods, we have expanded upon SDG-related keywords sourced from the Elsevier's Scopus database, as well as documentation provided by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network and the United Nations. By analysing course titles, aims, objectives, and course outlines, we have identified a total of 572 courses at HKBU that incorporate SDG-related keywords.

#### Research mapping

HKBU has implemented a structured approach to mapping research contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the year 2024. This process involves leveraging both SciVal and the Integrated Research Information and Management Systems (IRIMS) to identify scholars and their publications that align with specific SDGs. SciVal, an integral tool within the Elsevier Research Intelligence ecosystem, uses a machine learning model to link publications to the corresponding SDGs. Conversely, within IRIMS, research outputs are tagged with relevant SDGs using an algorithm tested and validated by Elsevier. This algorithm uses a targeted keyword search mechanism to determine the alignment of research outputs with individual SDGs.

## Teaching and Learning, Outreach and Engagement Empowering grassroots communities by alleviating day-to-day struggles

The General Education capstone course, "Service-learning in Fighting Poverty", taught by Dr Wong Kin-ming, led 21 students to explore poverty issues through lectures and community engagement activities. Collaborating with 9 non-governmental organisations and social enterprises, students interacted with the 445 members from the grassroots community in Hong Kong by actively participating in community programmes. These included collecting leftovers from wet markets and developing digital resources for underprivileged children. Students also engaged in multiple service-learning projects, devising innovative solutions to alleviate poverty and promote social inclusion in the community. At the end of the course, they showcased their service-learning experiences and reflections in booklets, raising public awareness of poverty issues and social equality in Hong Kong.

## Research

#### Inequality and deprivation in an affluent community: A case study of the livelihood of low-income households in Central and Western District, Hong Kong

*Department of Social Work*  Author: Vincent Wan Ping LEE

The article examines the livelihood of the underprivileged groups in the Central and Western District of Hong Kong, an area often being seen as affluent. It found that many lowincome families face grave challenges, such as high housing costs, inadequate living conditions and shortage of educational resources. The qualitative interviews with residents and community stakeholders revealed problems like strained relationships among these families, and a lack of educational support for children. Despite living in an affluent district, these families struggle with financial burdens that affect their well-being and opportunities. To promote social inclusion, it suggests that the government and community groups should prioritise affordable housing for these families and provide educational support for the children through tutoring services and the donation of resources like books and digital devices.

## Sustainability Initiatives

In the 2023/24 academic year, the University awarded over 2,800 scholarships totaling $104 million to 2,086 outstanding students. Among these, more than 170 scholarships, amounting to $2.73 million, were specifically designated for undergraduate students demonstrating proven financial need. Additionally, over 170 bursaries and emergency grants, generously funded by private organisations, professional bodies, businesses, and individuals, were provided to support students facing financial challenges. A total of 295 applicants received the First-Generation University Student Fund in 2023/24, enabling these students to unlock their potential and engage in a variety of enriching learning experiences beyond the traditional classroom.

### SDG 02: **ZERO HUNGER**

End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.

# Teaching and Learning, Outreach and Engagement

#### Nourishing change from surplus to service

In the service-learning course "Global Challenges II", Dr Daisy Tam, Associate Professor at the Academy of Language and Culture, challenged the students to explore the complexity of sustainable eating through a transdisciplinary approach. The students delved into the intricate food system, seeking sustainable solutions by engaging in hands-on activities with the local charity, Breadline, which involved collecting surplus bakery items and distributing them to street dwellers. They also had the opportunity to exchange canteen practices with international universities and shared their insights with local secondary school students. Reflecting on their experiences, the students created posters that depicted their vision for the future of canteens, aiming to promote the message of zero hunger.

### Connecting communities: Redistributing bread to the needy

The "Replacing Hunger with a Smile" Bread Redistributing Service Programme, in collaboration with the non-profit organisation Foodlink, involved collecting safe-to-eat surplus food and delivering it to those in need. Dr Gray Ho, the Resident Master of C. L. Soong Hall in the Undergraduate Halls, initiated this meaningful activity. A group of 18 participants collected unsold bread from bakery shops and learned to use food waste processors and garbage disposal systems. The collected bread was then redistributed to the hungry and needy. Students enjoyed the overall voluntary experience and felt contented with serving the community. This activity allowed students to understand the problem of food waste and the challenges faced by low-income households, the homeless, and others in need, while also helping to reduce hunger in Hong Kong.

The jelly-like mushroom tastes delicious and helps clean forests and preserve food. This study focuses on this particular edible jelly fungus Dacryopinax spathularia, which can be found in warm places all over the world. As it feeds on dead wood, it breaks it down and returns nutrients to the environment, making it an essential part of the forest ecosystem. As well as being used in food production, this fungus is a natural preservative. There was no complete genetic blueprint for this particular jelly fungus available. Intrigued by this fungus, the consortium has now sequenced its genome. This information will enable the community to comprehend how the fungus functions, its evolutionary process, and its production of natural preservatives.

This new knowledge is crucial for food sustainability. Understanding how the fungus produces its natural preservatives may enable researchers to develop new, eco-friendly methods for preserving food and decreasing waste. This could lead to increased food availability for all while minimising environmental impact. Therefore, this small mushroom could be the key to a more sustainable food future, inspiring everyone to work towards a better world.

#### Alternate wetting and drying irrigation enhances grain filling of inferior spikelets for different rice cultivars

*Department of Biology*  Corresponding authors: ZHANG Jianhua, ZHANG Hao, YANG Jianchang

The long-standing collaboration in rice production research has yielded valuable insights. Previous studies demonstrated significant enhancements in rice yield and water use efficiency through the adoption of an alternate wetting/drying (AWD) irrigation scheme, leading to notable impacts in rice production. Building on this foundation, our latest research reveals that integrating nitrogen use efficiency with AWD practices can further enhance rice cultivation methods. This novel approach holds practical significance for rice production.

In the recent study on nitrogen use efficiency under AWD water management, the team explored the interplay between irrigation strategies and nitrogen application rates on grain yield, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and water use efficiency (WUE) in rice. Conducted over two years with varying irrigation regimes and nitrogen application ra te s , t h e re s u l t s h i g h l i g h te d the superior performance of the moderate nitrogen (MN) rate under the alternate wetting and moderate drying (AWMD) regime, showcasing increased grain yield, NUE, and WUE attributed to improved physiological processes in roots and shoots. This research underscores the potential synergistic benefits of combining AWMD with optimal nitrogen levels for enhancing rice production sustainability.

# Sustainability Initiatives

#### Responsible procurement and dining practices

HKBU has implemented a *Sustainable Procurement Policy* to minimise the environmental impact of its purchases across the product lifecycle — from raw materials to final disposal. Complementing this policy, the *Sustainable Food Policy* prohibits the procurement and consumption of certain unsustainable food items, such as those with conservation concerns or high environmental impact, in the University's catering services and dining outlets. This promotes the responsible sourcing of food products and ensures the campus community has access to a diverse range of safe, nutritious, and eco-friendly dining options, setting a positive example and contributing to a more sustainable, food-secure future.

#### Affordable dining options

A number of catering outlets offering food at affordable prices or discounts are available on campus for students and staff, with a wide range of healthy dining options, spanning Chinese and Western dishes, quick bites, vegetarian options, and Halal-certified food provided to the HKBU community.

#### Office pantries for staff

The University maintains office pantries across campus, providing staff with a designated space to take breaks and enjoy complimentary snacks and beverages. These pantries foster a relaxing atmosphere that encourages peer interaction and recharging. Additionally, staff can visit the diverse range of catering outlets on campus for their dining needs.

### Staff activities on food waste upcycling

In alignment with the University's sustainability and zero hunger initiatives, the Human Resources Office has organised staff activities focused on upcycling food waste. During these hands-on workshops, participants learned about food waste challenges in the local community and transformed food waste into practical items such as jewellery and plant pots. The most recent session, held on 26 July 2024, was well-attended by staff keen to take part in this educational and creative endeavour.

### Campus food waste tracking

The University has taken a proactive approach to addressing food waste through its participation in the Pilot Scheme on Food Waste Collection Services organised by the Environmental Protection Department. Between July 2023 and June 2024, a total of around 54,000kg of food waste generated within the University campus was collected through this initiative. The collected food waste is then transported to O · PARK1, a resource recovery centre in Hong Kong, where advanced anaerobic digestion technology is employed to convert the food waste into biogas for electricity generation, with the residues utilised as compost.

Furthermore, the University has introduced food waste collection bins at the pantry in selected offices since May 2024, as a pilot initiative to enhance food waste recycling among staff. The effectiveness of this programme will be regularly assessed, with plans to progressively expand the service to additional offices where deemed suitable, encouraging broader participation in food waste reduction and recycling practices across the University community.

#### PATNet: Propensity-adjusted temporal network for joint imputation and prediction using binary electronic health records with observation bias

*Department of Computer Science* Authors: Kejing YIN*, Dong QIAN, William K. CHEUNG *Corresponding author

This study presents a novel method to improve the robustness of data imputation and clinical predictions of electronic health records (EHRs), with the ultimate goal of facilitating good health and well-being. Most existing clinical prediction models ignore the inherent observation bias in binary medical data, compromising the reliabilities of the predictions. In this work, the team tackles this issue by explicitly modelling the patterns of missing data and their dependencies on patients, features, and time. To this end, the team develop a tailored neural network that estimates the propensity score and the imputation simultaneously. Additionally, a low-rank approximation is adopted to render the propensity score learnable. By accurately capturing missing patterns, one can mitigate observation bias by imputing the missing data, thereby improving the reliability and robustness of clinical predictions generated.

PM2.5 poses significant health risks by penetrating deep into the bloodstream via inhalation, leading to systemic toxicity. Epidemiological studies link PM2.5 exposure to an increased risk of metabolic disorders, including cardiovascular diseases. These risks are exacerbated by high-fat, high-cholesterol diets (HFCD), which disrupt metabolic processes. The liver, central to lipid and cholesterol metabolism and detoxification, is crucial in this context. This study uses a real-world PM2.5 exposure system to explore how PM2.5 combined with HFCD affects cardiovascular health, particularly through mechanisms of liver damage. Key findings include the mechanisms by which PM2.5 exposure disrupted cholesterol homeostasis and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) production in the liver of mice on an HFCD diet, leading to elevated levels of non-HDL cholesterol in the blood. Also, PM2.5 exposure stimulated the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the circulation system, thereby hindering the liver's clearance of oxidised LDL, thereby the oxidative stress in the liver.

There is an urgent need to identify promising targets for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. In the TNBC xenograft and syngeneic models that saw the loss of sclerostin, the tumour progression/metastasis almost halted. Neither recombinant sclerostin protein nor sclerostin antibody had any effects in TNBC cells and mouse models, suggesting that the role of extracellular and systemic sclerostin could be excluded. Genetically, a transgenic TNBC cell line only producing non-secreted intracellular sclerostin induced significant acceleration of TNBC progression/metastasis. Pharmacologically, the team designed an aptamer-based PROTAC with excellent intracellular sclerostin degradation activity, which induced significant TNBC inhibition *in vitro* and i*n vivo*. Furthermore, it was uncovered that the interaction between intracellular sclerostin and caprin-1 was essential for intracellular sclerostin to drive TNBC progression/metastasis. This study uncovered an unrecognised role of intracellular sclerostin in TNBC development and proposed a viable intracellular sclerostin degrader strategy (aptamer-based PROTAC), which contributed to the health and well-being in line with SDG 3.

Sea bass (Lateolabrax maculatus) is more than just a tasty fish; it has therapeutic benefits for inflammation-linked conditions. Studies have demonstrated that sea bass can ameliorate

ulcerative colitis (UC), an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), by inhibiting TLR4 signalling pathway. An imbalance of gut microbiome can promote IBD progression. This research reveals that sea bass has the ability to rebalance the gut bacteria in UC mice. An increase in a particular beneficial bacterium, *Christensenella minuta*, could be a sign that sea bass is effectively improving the gut environment in UC. This study provides additional pharmacological justifications for eating sea bass to control UC, contributing to better

health and well-being in line with SDG 3. *Sea bass ameliorates UC through inhibiting inflammatory responses and increasing Christensenella minuta (C. minuta).*

## Sustainability Initiatives

#### Comprehensive healthcare services for the University community

The University provides comprehensive healthcare services to support the well-being of its students, staff, and their families. Through a holistic approach, the University prioritises both physical and mental health within the campus community.

On the physical front, the University offers quality on-campus medical services at the Health Services Centre, which is run by an appointed medical group and provides a range of services, including routine check-ups, consultations, and treatment for minor illnesses or injuries. To further extend accessible and affordable healthcare options, the University also collaborates with off-campus dental service providers to offer discounted rates for the University community. Recognising the benefits of integrating both Western and traditional Chinese medicine practices, the University operates its own School of Chinese Medicine clinics, both on and off campus, which provide discounted Chinese medicine clinical services to students, eligible staff, and their family members.

In addition to promoting physical well-being, the University places a strong emphasis on mental health support. The Counselling and Development Centre offers free and confidential counselling services for eligible students, as well as consultation and referral services for staff. A team of dedicated counsellors is available to assist students who may be experiencing emotional distress, or any other concerns related to their well-being.

#### Health promotion and outreach

The University's proactive approach to healthcare extends to various health promotion and outreach programmes.

The annual Medical Clinic Welcoming Programme provides first-year students with complimentary vital health assessments, including measurements of height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse, as well as examinations for colour vision, visual acuity, and a review of health questionnaires. This comprehensive screening helps to identify any potential health concerns early on.

Recognising the importance of sexual and reproductive healthcare, the University regularly hosts seminars and webinars featuring healthcare experts. For example, in September 2023, a session titled "What We Need to Know about HPV Prevention" was conducted for the student community.

Committed to promoting mental health, in October and November 2023, HKBU launched the "MENsday@HKBU" campaign to raise awareness about mental wellness and the importance of stress release, with a focus on male colleagues. The campaign attracted around 800 participants. Additionally, the University organised a series of workshops and activities on mental health, mindfulness, and stress release. Between November 2023 and April 2024, five classes of "Mental Health First Aid Standard Course" were offered, both in online and faceto-face formats. The course was taught by instructors from Mental Health Association of Hong Kong and Counselling and Development Centre of the Office of Student Affairs, and designed to deepen staff's understanding of mental health and equip them with the knowledge to support those in need.

To maintain workplace well-being, the University has participated in the Joyful@Healthy Workplace Charter, organised by the Department of Health and Occupational Safety and Health Council, to emphasise the importance of having a joyful and healthy workforce and promoting physical and mental well-being among staff members.

![](_page_11_Picture_19.jpeg)

HKBU has also collaborated with local, national, or global health institutions to improve health and well-being outcomes. Throughout the year, the University collaborates with local medical institutions to offer discounted human papillomavirus and seasonal influenza vaccinations to eligible students, staff, and their family members. Additionally, information sessions were organised to promote overall physical and mental well-being. For example, a seminar on eye care, was jointly

![](_page_12_Picture_1.jpeg)

organised by the University and Eye Fund, a local non-profit making charitable organisation, to deepen the understanding of common eye diseases and promote office eye care tips.

#### Provision of Chinese medicine healthcare services to the public

HKBU has long been committed to providing exemplary Chinese medicine clinical services to the public. By leveraging its specialised expertise, the University offers holistic treatments that address both physical and mental aspects of health.

Since 1999, the University has delivered a full range of quality Chinese medicine healthcare through the efforts of the School of Chinese Medicine. This includes operating an extensive network of nine self-run and seven jointly operated clinics, which have served over 3.5 million patients across Hong Kong. To enhance accessibility and affordability, the University implements initiatives such as discounted services for the elderly, credit card holders, and those under social assistance schemes.

Beyond direct healthcare, the University promotes public education through free consultations, body constitution tests, and regular seminars. The clinics also serve as platforms for Chinese medicine student training and academic research to advance evidence-based practices.

#### Establishment of the Chinese Medicine Hospital

As the contractor of the first Chinese Medicine Hospital (CMH) in Hong Kong, HKBU is committed to promoting the standardisation and internationalisation of Chinese medicine, while incorporating sustainability into its medical service provisions and daily operations.

Planned to commence operation in phases from the end of 2025, the CMH will be an integral part of Hong Kong's healthcare system. It will provide a range of primary, secondary, and tertiary care services, with a focus on developing specialised Chinese medicine offerings. The CMH will identify specific priority disease areas for strategic development, considering the medical needs of Hong Kong population, the unique strengths of Chinese medicine, as well as the availability of talents and collaborative support from other institutions.

#### Social change, culture and creativity: Music education in China

*Academy of Music* Author: Wai Chung HO

This research examines how evolving societal dynamics impact creativity in music education, a crucial factor for ensuring quality and inclusive education in line with SDG 4. By analysing curricula and interviewing students/educators, the project sheds light on the challenges facing higher music programmes in China, including Hong Kong.

The key finding is a pressing need to reform higher music education to better prepare the next generation. Currently, rigid curricula and assessment methods stifle the creative expression essential for musical growth and development. To achieve SDG 4, these programmes must evolve to provide more learner-centred, collaborative, and interdisciplinary learning opportunities. This will empower students to cultivate the creative skills they need to thrive.

Ultimately, this research offers valuable insights to guide reforms in higher music education across China and Hong Kong. Such changes can ensure equitable access to quality, creativity-focused training – a foundation for lifelong learning and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

#### AI recruiting and workplace diversity, equity, and inclusion

*Department of Management, Marketing and Information Systems* Authors: Grace Yuekun GAO, Jueni LYU, Christy M.K. CHEUNG* *Corresponding author

Advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace has become increasingly prioritised across industries and sectors for the goal of sustainable development. The rapid development of AI-enhanced recruitment tools presents a promising avenue for achieving DEI in the workplace. While the use of AI recruiting receives increasing attention from the industry, research on AI recruiting and workplace DEI remains fragmented and dispersed across disciplines. Our literature analysis revealed that research on AI recruiting and DEI in the workplace spans multiple disciplines, lacks theoretical frameworks, predominantly uses scenario-based experiments, and mainly focuses on the US context with human participants. Through a systematic literature analysis, the current stage of research was described, an integrative framework was presented, and the future research agenda was offered. It is hoped that this guide can inspire future investigations, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive understanding of AI recruiting can DEI in the workplace.

#### The impact of the top management team's gender diversity on target choice regarding corporate social responsibility performance

*Department of Management, Marketing and Information Systems Department of Accountancy, Economics and Finance* Authors: Jongsoo KIM, Y. Anthony KIM, Liqun WEI, Gaoguang ZHOU

The project aims to disclose female executives' role in facilitating the company's corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance. Based on the data of Standard & Poor's 500 firms during 2000 to 2019, it was found that companies with a higher proportion of female in their top management teams are more likely to engage in acquiring firms with good CSR performance, and that such acquisitions in turn improve the companies' CSR performance. In other words, companies can improve their CSR engagement and performance through activities such as mergers and acquisitions (M & A). The project opens a new window for realising the sustainable development of societies through more CSR engagement at a more micro-level, i.e., the firm level.

It further examines the CEO's contextual role along the process. i.e., for companies with female CEOs or CEOs who own larger shares. The companies having higher percentages of female executives in their top teams are even more likely to engage in acquiring high-CSR firms. This provides a more refined and comprehensive understanding of senior executives' influences in company behaviour related to their sustainability.

#### Fate of quaternary ammonium compounds upon the UV/monochloramine process: Kinetics, transformation pathways and the formation of N-nitroso-N-methyl-Nalkylamines

*Department of Chemistry*

*Corresponding author

The potential risks to human health associated with emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment have raised concerns among scientists, environmentalists and public officials worldwide. Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are extensively used in disinfectants, pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Due to their exceptional antibacterial properties, QACs were heavily used during the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to be heavily used as COVID-19 becomes endemic. The widespread use of these antibacterial products has led to the detection of QACs in the aquatic environment.

To better understand the potential threats posed by these QACs, the transformation of these chemicals in water has been studied - when water containing QACs is treated with the UV/monochloramine (UV/NH2Cl) process, toxic N-nitroso-N-methyl-N-alkylamines (NMAs) are formed. This study provides the first evidence that QACs are specific and significant precursors of NMAs. Further, it reveals that the molar formation yield of NMAs formed from QACs is much higher than the yield of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a classic notorious emerging contaminant. From the in silico prediction, it shows that these NMAs exhibit much higher toxicity than their parent QACs and NDMA. Greater attention should be given to the formation of NMAs and their potential threats to the ecosystems and humans.

#### Anaerobic mono-digestion and co-digestion of food waste and mixed sewage sludge: A comparative analysis of metabolic patterns and taxonomic profiles

*Department of Biology* Authors: Lijun LUO, Nirakar PRADHAN* *Corresponding author

The study explored how various organic waste types influence biogas yield and microbial dynamics in anaerobic digestion, assessing both individual and mixed waste sources. It was found that mono-digestion of food waste (FW) produced the highest methane yield (377.25 ± 29.55 mL/g VSfed), while co-digestion with waste-activated sludge (WAS) enhanced stability and reduced the lag phase.

Microbial analysis revealed a dominance of Firmicutes, especially Clostridium, in FW treatments, in contrast to the diverse microbes present in sludge treatments. Enzymatic activities suggested a degradation sequence from starch to cellulose, which was supported by gas and organic acid profiles. The study indicates that selecting the appropriate feedstock combination is key to optimising methane production, and that multi-omics approaches could address challenges associated with the slow degradation rate of proteins. Furthermore, this research advances our understanding and offers guidance for more sustainable organic waste management for clean energy and biofertiliser production.

#### Revenue analysis of spot and forward solar energy sales in Texas

*Centre for Sustainable Development Studies and Department of Accountancy, Economics and Finance*  Authors: Han Steffan QI*, Kang Hua CAO, Chi Keung WOO, Raymond LI, Jay ZARNIKAU *Corresponding author

Large-scale solar generation development in Texas is projected to continue albeit below figure's declining levelised price trend of solar power purchase agreements (PPAs). Collaborating with Dr C.K. Woo of the Centre and a team of international researchers, Dr Cao uses Texas's electricity market data to quantify a solar generation developer's revenue forecasts and risks of solar PPAs. These forecast results reveal the developer's optimal trade-off between spot and forward solar energy sales, akin to the risk-return relationship rooted in Markowitz's portfolio theory. Real-world relevant and policy important for Texas's electric grid and those around the world with wholesale market competition, this empirical finding informs the market economics and risks of solar capacity expansion, a critical element of the deep decarbonisation pathway for attaining the net zero target of the United Nations.

This work aims to tackle excessive CO2 and food shortages by addressing challenges in scaling up artificial photosynthesis in microreactors. Previous microreactors showed advantages of enzyme immobilisation but lacked efficiency due to low enzyme density. This work used a layer-by-layer strategy to trap enzymes in a 3D layered structure, providing an ideal environment for efficient conversion. These tiny reactors continuously convert CO2 into a glucose precursor, demonstrating significant improvements in activity, stability, and reusability compared to free enzymes. This suggests a high potential for mass production, offering a sustainable solution for both food supply and carbon neutralisation in the near future.

## Research

### Engaging employees in value cocreation: interplay among firm, employee, and supervisor

*Department of Management, Marketing and Information Systems*  Authors: Muhammad AMIN, Kimmy W. CHAN*, Amjad SHAMIM, Zulkipli Bin GHAZALI, Fong-Woon LAI *Corresponding author

The research explores how companies in the service industry can better involve their frontline employees in creating valuable experiences for customers – a process known as value cocreation (VCC). The study focuses on the ability of the company to facilitate interactions (interaction capabilities), the motivation of employees to engage with customers, and the role of supervisors with proactive personalities in providing opportunities for employees. The findings show that a company's ability to interact effectively and positively influences employees' motivation to cocreate value. Moreover, when supervisors are proactive, this effect is even stronger, leading to more active employee involvement in VCC. This research is significant because it helps companies understand how to better engage employees in VCC, which can lead to more sustainable and inclusive economic growth – aligning with the United Nations' goal of decent work for all.

#### Blockchain-based data security and sharing for resource-constrained devices in manufacturing IoT

*Department of Computer Science* Authors: Jinbiao TAN, Jianhua SHI, Jiafu WAN*, Hong-Ning DAI, Jiong JIN, Rui ZHANG *Corresponding author

Resource-constrained devices in manufacturing Internet of Things (MIoT) can collect a huge amount of privacy-sensitive data. It becomes a challenge to achieve privacy-preserving data sharing due to MIoT's resource limitations. To this end, this article originally presents a novel secure data-sharing scheme based on blockchain and data obscurification mechanisms. Specifically, a resource-assistance mechanism is devised via blockchain-based smart contracts. Meanwhile, polygon semantic rules were adopted to strengthen the security of MIoT data. Extensive experiments have been conducted in a customised candy-wrapping production line to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method can be further extended to other customised factories.

## Research

#### Social movements' impact on managerial discretion: Empowering Chief Diversity Officers post-George Floyd's death

*Department of Management, Marketing and Information Systems Department of Accountancy, Economics and Finance*  Authors: Seok-Hyun HWANG, Yoon Hoo KIM* *Corresponding author

This study examines the role of Chief Diversity Officers (CDOs) in promoting diversity initiatives in their companies before and after George Floyd's death in 2020. Unlike existing research, which mainly looks at industry-related factors influencing managerial discretion, this study explores how broader social issues impact CDOs' effectiveness in leading diversity initiatives. By conceptualising the post-2020 period as a time when CDOs gained more influence due to heightened public demand for racial justice, the team posits that the period after Floyd's death, marked by heightened public demand for racial justice, empowered CDOs to significantly enhance diversity strategies. Furthermore, using a framework that considers different types of executive power, the study highlights how different sources of power aligned with the changing social landscape. Early findings generally supported the study's predictions.

#### Untold stories of Hong Kong

## Research

### Seeing the unseen – NIR non-intrusive detection technology

#### *Department of Physics* Authors: Zhuangmiao WANG, Yu TANG, Feng GAO, Xiaopeng QIU, Furong ZHU* *Corresponding author

With good penetration ability, near infrared (NIR) is widely used for detecting chemical compositions of food, Chinese medicinal material and other organic matter by measuring their spectral fingerprint. For example, it can estimate the sugar levels in fruits through monitoring the change in NIR absorption by sugar molecules in the fruits. However, NIR signals collected from fruits planted outdoor may not be accurate enough to evaluate their quality, as the conventional sensors response to both visible and NIR light.

Professor Zhu and his team have invented a novel visible/NIR dual-mode sensor technology that can detect visible light or NIR light selectively without interference. The team has developed a portable Fruit Quality Detector that picks up NIR signal accurately even in the brightest ambient light conditions. The results can be compared with its own database through an algorithm, to calculate the fruit quality, such as sugar content and acidity content, enabling instant portable material analysis and interconnected ecosystem of realtime data integrated with IoT solutions. Further potential applications could be explored in the healthcare domain, enabling improved body management for health screening and blood sugar measurement.

*Department of Chemistry* Authors: Qingqing TAO, Felipe Nunes HENRIQUEZ, Kang DING, Wai Lun MAN, Matthew Y.Y. LUI* *Corresponding author

Chitin is a highly abundant and renewable material that holds significant promise for applications in the biomedical and food industries. It is typically sourced from the discarded shells of food waste, making it an eco-friendly option. However, traditional methods of isolating chitin rely heavily on the use of large quantities of harmful and corrosive chemicals. In this research, the team has developed an innovative chitin isolation process that employs a recyclable ionic liquid. This new method not only reduces the reliance on hazardous chemicals but also yields chitin with enhanced properties compared to commercially available products, making it a more sustainable and efficient alternative.

#### Arctic amplification-induced decline in West and South Asia dust warrants stronger antidesertification toward carbon neutrality

#### *Department of Geography*

Authors: Fan WANG, Yangyang XU, Piyushkumar N PATEL, Ritesh GAUTAM, Meng GAO*, Cheng LIU*, Yihui DING, Haishan CHEN, Yuanjian YANG, Yuyu ZHOU, Gregory R CARMICHAEL, Michael B MCELROY *Corresponding author

This research explores the decline in dust loading in West and South Asia over the past two decades, attributing this trend to Arctic amplification due to anthropogenic global warming. By linking the reduction in dust levels to Arctic amplification-driven atmospheric alterations impacting dust emissions and transport, it underscores the intricate interplay between climate change and environmental phenomena in these regions. Climate model simulations corroborate the substantial role of greenhouse gas-induced Arctic amplification in shaping dust loading trends.

Furthermore, this research alerts to the potential adverse effects of carbon neutrality efforts leading to increased regional dust loading, stressing the importance of proactive anti-desertification measures such as reforestation and improved irrigation management. It highlights the necessity of integrated strategies to address climate change impacts on dust dynamics in West and South Asia while advocating for sustainable land management practices to combat desertification effectively.

#### Emotional responses and psychological health among young people amid climate change, Fukushima's radioactive water release, and wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the mediating roles of media exposure and nature connectedness

*School of Continuing Education*  Authors: Sam S S LAU*, Cherry C Y HO *Corresponding author

#### **Addressing psychological burdens of youth emotional engagement in the climate crisis, alongside other global crises**

Sustained climate action from individuals faces many psychological hurdles, just as nations encounter technological, financial, and political barriers in combating the climate crisis. Climate anxiety is considerably taxing to youths, especially as our planet is becoming increasingly vulnerable to climate-related and man-made disasters. In light of these emerging long-term global crises, our multi-country study reconceptualised the landscape perceived by youths, to which the climate crisis (C) is not experienced in isolation, but concurrently with war or armed-conflict crises (W) and radioactive-ecological crises (R), all of which shape the emotional responses of youths to global events.

Our findings suggest that global crises had compounding risks associated with a set of highly correlated negative emotions, including a shared sense of cross-crisis guilt prominently displayed by Chinese respondents. Total emotional engagement in ecological crises (but not wars) lead to worse psychological health outcomes, chiefly independent of respective media exposure, but strongly alleviated by nature connectedness. Grassroots support for SGD 13 relies on more than just climate messaging, but it must also address the compounded anxiety stemming from multiple global crises.

#### Communicating environment protection from plastic waste via VR: Effects of realism and spatial presence on risk perception

*Department of Communication Studies*  Authors: Ran WEI*, Shuhua ZHOU, Renyi HE, Kanni HUANG *Corresponding author

This experiment tested the utility of virtual reality (VR) technologies in building public awareness of an environmental issue – the growing pollution of plastic waste in oceans. The team conducted an experiment to test whether viewing of VR video would produce two types of immersive experiences (e.g., perceived realism and spatial presence) in severely polluted oceans, and to further examine their effects on participants' pro-environmental attitude with regards to reducing plastic waste. Results showed that VR viewing led to higher perceived realism and spatial presence in comparisons with 2D video and audioonly conditions; perceived realism contributed significantly to pro-environmental attitude, whereas spatial presence did not. The higher the perceived realism, the stronger the pro-environmental attitude. These results have implications for the effective use of VR technologies in environmental communication.

#### Applications of charcoal, activated charcoal, and biochar in aquaculture – A review

*School of Continuing Education*  Authors: Ka Lai CHOW, Yu Bon MAN* *Corresponding author

Environmental pollution and poor feed quality pose potential threats to aquatic organisms and human health, representing challenges for the aquaculture industry. In light of the rising demand for aquatic organisms, there is an urgent need to improve aquacultural production and protect the products from contamination. Char, a carbonaceous material derived through pyrolysis of organic carbon-rich biomass, has proven advantages in soil, air, and water remediation. Char's performance and the associated physicochemical characteristics depend strongly on the pyrolysis temperature, residence time, and feedstock type. It generally shows advantages in pollutant removal from the environment and livestock. This review summarises major studies on three applications: aquacultural water treatment, sediment remediation, and char-feed supplement. Most of these studies have demonstrated char's positive effects on pollutant removal from organisms and aquacultural environments; while an adoption of char as fish feed can improve fish growth performance and the condition of their intestinal villi.

#### Ecoregion-wise fractional mapping of tree functional composition in temperate mixed forests with sentinel data

*Department of Mathematics* Authors: Ziyu LIN, K.H. CHENG, Dedi YANG, Fei XU, Guangqin SONG, Ran MENG, Jing WANG, Xiaolin ZHU, Michael NG, Jin WU* *Corresponding author

Climate change can make changes to where species live, how they interact, and the timing of biological processes, which could fundamentally transform the ecosystems. This research examines temperate mixed forest ecosystems which are composed of various tree functional types (TFTs) that differ in canopy structure, phenology, and physiological response to climate change. An accurate characterisation of the composition of these TFTs is important for quantifying land surface carbon, energy, and water cycling, as well as process-based simulation of forest dynamics. By using advanced computational and statistical techniques, the space-time TFT variability of satellite signatures is analysed and an accurate and generalisable approach is provided for sub-pixel fraction mapping across temperate mixed landscapes and mixed forest ecosystems.

This study examined the cardiovascular risks linked to inhaling arsenic-laden fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at a non-ferrous metal smelting site, revealing arsenic exposure levels up to 120 times the national standards in the PM2.5 pollutants, primarily in the form of As(V) and As(III). In the following animal exposure study using this environmental relevant concentration, arsenic bioaccumulation in a mouse model reached equilibrium after 8 weeks, with a bioavailability of 24.5%. The toxicological explore in animals showed that PM2.5-As exposure led to significant cardiac injury and dysfunction. The findings underscored the urgent need for stricter regulations and enhanced protective measures to safeguard workers' health in such environments.

### Federated generalised face presentation attack detection

*Department of Computer Science* Authors: Rui SHAO, Pramuditha PERERA, Pong Chi YUEN*, Vishal M. PATEL *Corresponding author

This paper addresses the privacy issue in face presentation attack detection (a.k.a. face antispoofing) without touching the original face data. Most existing face presentation attack detection methods require the original face images for training. In this work, we do not need the original data for training (i.e. following data-stay-local policy) but learned model information. At the same time, the learned model can perform well in unseen data. To achieve this, the team has developed a new federated domain disentanglement strategy to decompose domain-invariant and domain-specific features from face images. This work could facilitate distributed learning of a robust model from different sensitive small datasets.
